# **compare.cpp**
* This program compares the execution time of normal and SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) operations on vector and matrix calculations.
* The program measures the execution time using the high-resolution performance counter provided by the Windows API.

## Prerequisites
* Windows operating system
* Visual Studio installed
* Processor with SSE support

## Usage
* Open compare.cpp file in Visual Studio.
* Build and run the program.
* The program outputs the execution time of different operations on vector and matrix calculations.

## Features
The program compares the execution time of the following operations:
* Normal vector-vector addition
* SSE vector-vector addition
* Normal vector-vector multiplication
* SSE vector-vector multiplication
* Normal matrix-vector multiplication
* SSE matrix-vector multiplication

## Acknowledgments
* This program was created as an educational resource to demonstrate the performance benefits of SSE instructions on vector and matrix calculations.
